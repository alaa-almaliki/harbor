# Changelog

All notable changes to Harbor are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Optional backing services — a project can now run with no database at
  all.** `harbor init` asks which backing services a project needs: an
  interactive picker (numbered, alphabetical — the catalog derived from
  `templates/compose/services/*.yml.tmpl`: `elasticsearch`, `meilisearch`,
  `mysql`, `opensearch`, `rabbitmq`) when stdin is a terminal and `HARBOR_YES`
  is unset, or `--services "mysql,opensearch"` directly. `--services ""` /
  `--services none` (or typing `none` at the prompt) selects no containers —
  the manifest gets an explicit `services: {}` and the project has no
  `docker-compose.yml`. A non-interactive caller (script, CI, `HARBOR_YES=1`)
  silently gets the framework default, so existing scripted `harbor init`
  calls behave exactly as before. The manifest's `services:` key is
  authoritative whenever present — including an explicit empty map — and only
  an absent key falls back to the framework default, so manifests written
  before this feature keep working unchanged.
- **`harbor services` — change a project's backing services after `init`.**
  `harbor services <name>` opens the same interactive picker as `init`, with
  the project's current services preselected (pressing Enter keeps what's
  there, not the framework default). `harbor services list <name>` shows
  what's on/off with resolved images; `harbor services add|rm <name>
  <svc>...` changes the list directly — adding a service already present, or
  removing one that isn't, is a no-op, not an error. Writes the manifest and
  re-renders, but deliberately does **not** run `harbor up` (rendering is
  idempotent, restarting containers isn't). `HARBOR_YES=1` is the only
  bypass — there is no `--yes` flag.
- **`harbor render` now confirms before a manifest edit drops a service whose
  data volume still exists** — shrinking `services:` (by hand, or via
  `harbor services rm`, which routes through the same gate) used to silently
  stop the container and detach its volume. Removing a service does **not**
  destroy data: the volume stays (scoped to `name: harbor-<name>`) and
  re-adding the service reattaches it intact — only `harbor destroy` drops
  volumes, and the prompt says so plainly. Only prompts when the dropped
  service's Docker volume actually exists — growing the list, or shrinking a
  service that was never `up`ed, never prompts; if Docker is unreachable the
  check assumes the data is at risk and prompts anyway. Declining leaves the
  manifest, compose file, and running containers untouched. `HARBOR_YES=1` is
  the only bypass, same as every other destructive-op confirm.
- **Magento now names every missing required service in one shot**, instead
  of crashing or reporting only the first — `harbor install`/`harbor render`
  on a Magento project missing `mysql` or `opensearch` (its required services;
  RabbitMQ is optional) says exactly which ones, with a `magento needs:
  <missing services>` fix hint.

### Changed
- **Lifecycle commands no-op instead of erroring on a service-less project.**
  `harbor up`/`down`/`restart <name>`/`logs <name>` print "nothing to
  start/stop/restart" (or "no container logs") and exit 0 for a project with
  no services, rather than dying on a missing compose file — a bulk/scripted
  run over every project shouldn't fail just because one of them has no
  database.
- **`harbor init`'s manifest and connection files are now conditional on the
  resolved service list**, not written unconditionally for every project. The
  manifest `db:` block is only emitted when `mysql` is selected;
  `connection.env`/`connection.txt` only get `DB_*` when `mysql` is selected,
  and `OPENSEARCH_*`/`RABBITMQ_*`/`MEILISEARCH_*`/`ELASTICSEARCH_*` only when
  their service is selected — Redis and Mailpit stay unconditional since
  they're shared, always-on Harbor services.
- **`harbor doctor` no longer requires the `pdo_mysql` PHP extension** for a
  project with no database service (an explicit `extensions:` entry still
  wins).
- **`harbor ps` shows a distinct `db:-` marker** for a project with no
  `mysql` service, instead of a stale or blank port.

### Fixed
- **`connection.env`/`connection.txt` no longer advertise services a project
  never runs.** Both files were written unconditionally for every project
  regardless of which services were actually configured — a plain Laravel
  project (mysql only) got live-looking `OPENSEARCH_HOST`/`RABBITMQ_HOST`/
  `MEILISEARCH_HOST`/`ELASTICSEARCH_HOST` entries for containers that were
  never part of its stack. Both files now only include entries for services
  the project actually has.
- **`harbor mysql`/`harbor db backup`/etc. now refuse up front with a fix
  hint, instead of crashing or misreporting "stack not running,"** when a
  project has no database configured. `harbor wire` skips the `DB_*` lines
  for Laravel/CodeIgniter/Symfony/plain projects (still wires Redis + mail)
  and refuses early, with a fix hint, for a DB-less Magento project (which
  requires a database).
- **`harbor destroy` no longer leaks a project's Docker volume when the
  project has no services.** `destroy` now also removes any volume named
  `harbor-<name>_*` directly, whether or not a compose file is present; the
  match is anchored so a project whose name is a prefix of another's (`shop`
  vs `shop2`) can never catch the wrong one.
- **`harbor ps` no longer conflates "no database service" with "has `mysql`
  but a missing/broken port allocation."** `db:-` used to mean both — the
  same marker for two very different states. `ps` now checks whether the
  project has a `mysql` service before loading its ports, rendering a
  distinct `db:?` for "has `mysql` but no allocated ports," separate from
  `db:-` for "no `mysql` service."
- **A hand-edited bare `services:` (the obvious YAML way to write "none") no
  longer gets a project silently stuck on the framework default.** Presence
  of the `services:` key is now tested with a real presence check
  (`manifest_key_present`, `lib/manifest.sh`), not `manifest_has` (a VALUE
  test that reads an empty value the same as an absent key) — before this,
  a bare `services:` line resolved back to e.g. `mysql`, and `harbor services
  add <name> mysql` then reported "no change" with no way to actually add it.
  `manifest_has` itself is unchanged (still used elsewhere for its existing
  value semantics); the new helper is additive.
- **`harbor services rm`/`add` declining its confirm gate now restores the
  manifest's previous `services:` line byte-for-byte, comment included** —
  it used to rebuild the line from the resolved value (`manifest_get`, which
  strips trailing comments) and could also mis-detect a bare `services:` as
  "key was absent," restoring by deleting the line instead of putting the
  bare line back. Restoration now snapshots and replays the raw line
  (`manifest_raw_line`/`manifest_set_raw_line`).
- **A partial `harbor services rm` (the project still has other services
  left) now actually stops the dropped service's container**, instead of
  only rewriting `docker-compose.yml` and leaving it running until an
  unrelated `harbor down` — `docker compose up -d` merely warns about
  "orphans" and Harbor never passed `--remove-orphans`. `harbor render`
  now stops (and removes, without `-v`) just the dropped service(s) before
  rewriting the compose file; the rest of the stack, and all volumes, are
  left untouched.
- **`harbor destroy` no longer reports success while leaking every volume
  when Docker is unreachable.** Its volume sweep (`docker volume ls -q |
  grep ... || true`) used to turn a failed listing into the same empty
  result as "no matching volumes," so `destroy` would unlink, release ports,
  and print "destroyed" while the project's volumes stayed on disk with no
  Harbor command left able to reach them. `destroy` now distinguishes the
  two, still unlinks/releases ports (those don't need Docker), and reports
  the volume sweep as failed with a fix hint instead of claiming full
  success.
- **`harbor init --services none` (or any DB-less selection) no longer
  reports a `db port` in its summary line** — the port belongs to a `mysql`
  service that was never provisioned.

### Added
- **`harbor restart` with no project name restarts Harbor itself** — equivalent
  to `harbor stop && harbor start` (shared stack, php pools, dnsmasq, nginx).
  Running project stacks are left alone; `harbor restart <name>` still restarts
  just that project's containers. nginx is a LaunchDaemon, so the bare form asks
  for sudo (the same touchpoint `stop`/`start` already use — no new one).
- **`harbor init`/`new`/`render` seed self-documenting import-pipeline samples**
  into `.harbor/`: a commented-out `import-rules` (with the project's real
  domain baked into the examples) and one sample hook per phase —
  `hooks/post-import.d/10-local-overrides.sql.sample` for pinning table records
  to local values on every import (base URLs, dev passwords, clearing live API
  keys) and `hooks/pre-import.d/10-trim-dump.sh.sample` for trimming the dump
  before load — plus a `hooks/README.md` documenting each phase's contract and
  env vars. Everything is inert until edited (`#` rules are ignored, `.sample`
  hooks are skipped), non-clobbering, and existing projects pick it up on their
  next `harbor render <name>`.
- **Per-command help: `harbor <cmd> --help` and `harbor help <cmd>`.** Every
  command now has a topic covering its purpose, exact usage, **every flag it
  parses**, real examples, and the gotchas that cost you an hour — `harbor down`
  also flushes the project's Redis; `harbor composer` bypasses the PHP shim so
  `php_ini`/Xdebug don't reach Composer itself; `harbor media pull` is
  `rsync --delete` and isn't confirm-gated; `harbor tool` won't infer the project
  from your cwd. Ask however you like — `harbor php --help`, `harbor php use
  --help` and `harbor help php` all land on the same topic. Subcommands can have
  their own topic, keyed `<cmd>-<sub>` and reached with no extra wiring — so far
  `harbor db sandbox --help`. Help prints
  to **stdout and exits 0** (so it pipes), unlike the terse `usage:` one-liners on
  misuse, which stay on stderr and now point at `--help`. Commands that wrap
  another tool (`run`, `composer`, `artisan`, `console`, `spark`, `magento`,
  `node`, `npm`) pass `--help` **through** to that tool; their Harbor docs are at
  `harbor help <cmd>`. `harbor help <topic>` completes in bash/zsh.
- **`harbor update [--check] [--stash] [--yes]`: self-update.** Fetches `origin`
  and **fast-forwards** the checkout to `origin/main` (ff-only — never a merge
  commit or history rewrite), then **force-reseeds** the agent skill into every
  project so improvements propagate (overwrites the managed skill files in place,
  preserving any extra files you added). `--check` reports pending commits without
  applying (read-only); `--stash` auto-stashes/restores a dirty tree (otherwise a
  dirty tree aborts with a hint). After updating it prints the version/commit
  delta and the changelog range, then gives **targeted next steps** based on what
  changed — platform templates → `harbor setup`; compose templates →
  `harbor render/up`; libs → effective next command — and runs `doctor`. *Host
  footprint:* none of its own — it updates the git checkout and writes each app's
  `.claude/skills/harbor/` (already committable, in the app's repo, git-ignored by
  Harbor); it may *recommend* `harbor setup`, but never runs sudo itself.
- **Unit test suite** (`test/`): a zero-dependency, pure-bash harness
  (`test/run.sh` + `test/lib.sh`) that runs on macOS system bash 3.2 like Harbor
  itself — no `bats`, no installs. Covers the pure-logic units:
  `manifest.sh` (the constrained-YAML parser — flow maps/lists, nesting, quoted
  commas, comments), `ports.sh` (index → port/Redis-index math, allocation,
  idempotency, backfill), `common.sh` (`valid_name`, `db_ident`, `render_str`
  templating, `config_get`, `resolve_project`), and `search-replace.php`'s
  serialized-length recompute. Run with `harbor test` (or `./test/run.sh`);
  pass a name filter to scope it: `harbor test manifest`. No host mutation —
  tests use throwaway temp dirs and never touch Docker, launchd, or the sandbox.
- **`harbor test [filter]`**: run Harbor's own unit suite from the CLI (thin
  wrapper over `test/run.sh`; exits nonzero on any failure).
- **MIT license** (`LICENSE`) and a License section in the README.
- **Projects are seeded with an agent skill.** `harbor init` (and therefore
  `harbor new`), plus `harbor render` for already-existing projects, copies
  `ai/skills/harbor/` into the project at
  `projects/<name>/.claude/skills/harbor/` (`SKILL.md` + `reference.md`), so any
  coding agent working in that project knows how to drive Harbor for the app —
  run commands under the pinned PHP, DB import/backup/sandbox, logs, Xdebug,
  manifest config, containerized tools — without re-reading Harbor each time.
  Committable (travels with the app) and non-clobbering, so a re-init never
  overwrites project-side edits (delete the dir to pull a fresh copy). The
  canonical source lives in `ai/skills/harbor/`.
- **`harbor db sandbox <sub>`: a project-independent scratch MySQL** on
  `127.0.0.1:3306` for testing and checking things out, with its own lifecycle so
  you can create and destroy throwaway databases without attaching them to a
  project. Subcommands: `create <db> [user] [pass]`, `drop <db> [user]`, `list`,
  `backup <db> [file]`, `restore <db> <file>`, `console [db]`, `up`, `down`,
  `destroy`, `status`. A Harbor-owned singleton stack (`docker/sandbox.yml`, from
  `templates/compose/sandbox.yml.tmpl`) — loopback-only, RAM-capped, lazily started
  on first use. Reversible: `harbor teardown` stops it, `--purge` drops its data
  volume. Port/image overridable via `SANDBOX_MYSQL_PORT` / `SANDBOX_MYSQL_IMAGE`
  (a `mariadb:*` image runs MariaDB). *Host footprint:* one Docker container +
  named volume (`harbor-sandbox`) bound to `127.0.0.1:3306` while running.
- `harbor logs clear [all|nginx|php|dnsmasq|<name>]`: truncate Harbor's log files
  under `var/log/` in place (default `all`; `<name>` = that site's nginx logs).
  Truncates rather than deletes, so daemons keep their open handles (no orphaned
  inode, effective immediately).
- **nginx logs are user-owned.** Harbor pre-creates the global and per-site nginx
  log files before its root master opens them (`open()` with `O_CREAT` never
  chowns an existing file), so they're born user-owned — root still writes, but you
  can `harbor logs clear` them without sudo. Applied on `setup` and every `nginx`
  reload/`link`.
- **Optional backing services via compose-fragment assembly.** The per-project
  `docker-compose.yml` is now assembled from one fragment per service
  (`templates/compose/services/<svc>.yml.tmpl` + optional `volumes/<svc>…`) driven
  by the manifest `services:`, instead of two fixed whole-stack templates.
  Bundled: `mysql`, `opensearch`, `elasticsearch`, `rabbitmq`, `meilisearch`. Add a
  service by dropping a fragment + a `ports.sh` slot — no new template per combination.
- **`services:` is an explicit `{ name: "image:tag" }` map** written by `harbor
  init` with pinned versions, so every service's version is visible and editable in
  place — change a value and `harbor render`, no separate key to add. The DB image
  lives in `services.mysql` (the `db:` map is just credentials); resolution is
  `services.<svc>` → config `<SVC>_IMAGE` → baked-in default. Legacy list-format
  manifests (`services: [ … ]` + `db.image`) are migrated in place on the next
  `harbor render`.
- **Elasticsearch** opt-in service: single node, `xpack.security` disabled for
  local dev, loopback `127.0.0.1:<base+5>`, heap-capped (`ELASTICSEARCH_HEAP`),
  healthcheck; host/port in `connection.txt`.
- **Meilisearch** opt-in service: loopback `127.0.0.1:<base+4>`, healthcheck,
  indexing-memory cap; host + master key written to `connection.txt`/`connection.env`
  for Laravel Scout. `ports_ensure` backfills new port slots so existing projects
  can adopt a service via `harbor render` without re-allocating.
- `harbor render <name>`: regenerate a project's `docker-compose.yml` +
  `connection.env` from the manifest — the missing "edit the manifest, re-run the
  command" path for `services:` version changes (also materializes a legacy
  list-format `services:` into the map).
- **MariaDB support** as a MySQL-compatible image swap on the `mysql` entry (e.g.
  `services: { mysql: "mariadb:11.4" }`). The compose service stays named `mysql`
  (so `harbor mysql`/`db` keep working) and Harbor emits an engine-aware server
  command — MariaDB drops MySQL 8's `--default-authentication-plugin` flag, which
  it rejects.
- Per-project **scripts** dir: `projects/<name>/.harbor/scripts/`. Executables
  dropped there are on `PATH` — under the project's pinned PHP — for
  `harbor run <name> <script>` and `harbor shell <name>`, so a `scripts/invoice`
  becomes `harbor run <name> invoice`. It's committable (unlike the generated
  `.harbor/bin/` tool shims), so project-specific commands travel with the app;
  `harbor init` scaffolds it with a README. *(Host footprint: none — inside the
  project's `.harbor/`.)*
- `harbor stop` / `harbor start`: pause/resume Harbor (bootout/bootstrap the
  nginx daemon + dnsmasq/php agents, stop/start the shared stack) so its ports
  (`:80 :443 :6379 :1025 :8025`) can be handed to another Docker stack during
  migration. Keeps plists, resolver, and certs; `status` reports `STOPPED` and
  skips self-heal while paused. *(Host footprint: no new files; a `var/stopped`
  flag only.)*
- `.shellcheckrc` (sourced-library false positives) — codebase is now
  shellcheck-clean.

### Changed
- **`db import` is much faster on real-world dumps.** Two fixes to where the
  time actually went: (1) the load runs with `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2`
  (fsync per second instead of per commit — the classic dump-replay killer;
  restored to its previous value after) and `UNIQUE_CHECKS=0`, the same flag
  mysqldump puts in its own headers; (2) decompress + DEFINER-strip run as one
  streaming pass instead of copy-then-rewrite-in-place — half the disk IO.
  Each heavy phase now prints its own duration (`prepared in 2m 1s`,
  `loaded in 9m 40s`, …) so a slow import says where the time went. (A
  server-side `LIKE` pre-filter for the search/replace pass was prototyped and
  measured 2.5× *slower* than streaming rows into PHP — not shipped.)
- **`db import` ends with a summary: dump size, elapsed time, status.**
  `ok import complete -> shop (4.5G dump in 12m 4s)` — and a load that came
  from a truncated dump repeats its loud warning right above the summary, so
  the partial status can't scroll out of sight.
- **`harbor status`/`ps` color running projects green.** A project whose stack is
  `up` is printed as a green row so the running projects stand out at a glance;
  down projects stay uncolored. Color is TTY-gated (no escape codes when the output
  is piped or redirected).
- **README** now states up front that Harbor is **macOS-only** and **unstable /
  under active development**, that **code contributions are not accepted** (issues
  welcome), and documents the per-project **Claude Code agent skill** (new "For AI
  coding agents" section).
- **Optional `<name>` for the in-project commands.** `run`, `composer`, `artisan`,
  `console`, `spark`, `magento`, `node`, `npm`, `shell`, `mysql`, and `redis` now
  infer the project when you omit the name — from `$HARBOR_PROJECT` (set by
  `harbor shell`) or from the cwd being under `projects/<name>/` (symlinked projects
  resolved). So `harbor run invoice` / `harbor artisan migrate` / `harbor mysql`
  work from a project dir; an explicit existing-project arg still wins. (Reusable
  `resolve_project`/`cwd_project` helpers in `common.sh`.)
- Templating: added `render_str` (renders a template to stdout) so compose
  fragments can be concatenated; `render` now wraps it. Existing `render` calls
  are unchanged.

### Added
- **`db import` validates rules and hooks before doing any work.** A malformed
  rule (missing `=>`, empty FROM, invalid `re:` regex — each named with its
  line number) or a shell hook with a syntax error aborts in milliseconds
  instead of after the backup/load; a hook that would be silently skipped (not
  executable, or a `*.sql` misplaced in `pre-import.d/`) warns with the fix.
  `--replace` args are checked for `OLD=NEW` shape at parse time.
- **`db import` refuses a truncated dump up front.** A dump whose last line ends
  mid-statement (interrupted download/export) used to "succeed" partially:
  every table after the cut was silently missing — a Magento dump cut in the
  s's loads with no `store` or `url_rewrite` and nothing tells you. The import
  now dies before load with a re-download hint; `--force` keeps its best-effort
  meaning and loads the partial dump anyway (with a warning).

### Fixed
- **The README's Downloads badge no longer renders broken.** It used a shields.io
  `?endpoint=` badge, which makes shields fetch
  `.github/traffic/clones-badge.json` from raw.githubusercontent on every render
  — that hop returns HTTP 524 (Cloudflare: origin timed out) and the badge dies,
  even though the JSON itself is valid and served fine. The README now embeds a
  *static* shields badge with the count baked into the URL (no outbound fetch, so
  it can't 524), and the daily traffic workflow rewrites that URL in place.
  `clones-badge.json` is still written for anyone consuming it directly.
- **Four more silent-death guards squashed** — the `[ cond ] && …`-as-last-statement
  bug that once killed `db import` (CLAUDE.md §3). In each case a false guard
  became the function's return value, so a plain caller under `set -e` died with
  no error output at all:
  - **`harbor setup` on a vhost with no log directives.** `nginx_ensure_logs_all`
    returned nonzero when a site conf's `access_log`/`error_log` lines couldn't
    be parsed — which is exactly what a stale/hand-edited vhost looks like.
  - **`harbor render`/`init` for a service with no volume fragment.**
    `_compose_assemble` is called plainly as `… > docker-compose.yml`, so adding
    a volume-less service (the documented optional case) would have silently
    aborted stack generation.
  - **`installed_php_versions` when the last listed version isn't installed** —
    `setup`/`start`/`stop` all iterate it, so a missing newest PHP could have
    taken them down.
  - **`link_php_value_block` for a project with no `php_ini:` keys** — the
    default for a fresh `harbor init`; harmless at today's call site, but a trap
    for the next plain caller.

  Pinned by new `test/test_nginx.sh`, `test/test_compose.sh`, `test/test_link.sh`
  and added `installed_php_versions` coverage in `test/test_common.sh`.
- **`re:` regex rules actually work now — and can no longer blank data.** The
  documented bare-pattern form (`re:UA-\d+-\d+ =>`) was passed to
  `preg_replace()` without delimiters, which always fails — and the failure
  returned `null`, so a doc-following regex rule could overwrite matched
  columns with empty values. Bare patterns are now wrapped in delimiters
  automatically, compile-checked up front, and a regex that fails at runtime
  leaves the original value untouched.
- **The serialized-safe search/replace survives unique-key collisions and
  vanishing tables.** A rewrite that collapses two values onto one (staging +
  prod emails both mapped to `.test` colliding on `customer_entity`'s unique
  email index) used to abort the whole pass with a raw stack trace, as did a
  table dropped mid-scan (e.g. a concurrent import reloading the DB). Colliding
  rows and vanished tables are now skipped with a warning and a summary count;
  everything else still gets rewritten.
- **The serialized-safe search/replace no longer OOMs on large databases.** It
  read each table with a *buffered* `SELECT *` — the whole table in PHP memory —
  and died at the 128M CLI default on any real Magento DB. Reads now stream
  row-by-row (unbuffered, with a second connection for the UPDATEs), and the
  pass runs with `memory_limit=512M` headroom for large serialized blobs.
- **A non-executable file in a hooks dir no longer kills `db import` silently.**
  The hook runner's `[ -x "$f" ] && {…}` made the function return nonzero when
  the last entry wasn't executable, and `set -e` aborted the whole import with
  **no error output** — right after "stripping DEFINER clauses". The seeded
  `.sample` hooks triggered this on every project. Non-executable files are now
  skipped cleanly, and a hook that genuinely fails now aborts loudly with
  `hook failed: <file> (<phase>)` instead of a silent exit.
- **An import-rules file that strips to nothing no longer triggers the
  search/replace pass.** Blank lines survived the comment filter, so a
  fully-commented rules file (exactly what init now seeds) would have run the
  full serialized-replace table scan with zero rules on every import.
- **Asking for help never runs anything.** `--help`/`-h` used to be data to most
  commands, with real consequences: `harbor logs nginx --help` **hung** (any extra
  arg means "follow", so it started `tail -F`), `harbor xdebug on --help`
  **enabled Xdebug and restarted every PHP-FPM pool**, `harbor secure host --help`
  added `--help` as a certificate SAN, and `harbor php --help` reported
  `unsupported version '--help'`. Harbor now answers the flag wherever *it* is the
  one parsing — `harbor php use --help`, `harbor db sandbox create --help` and
  `harbor update --check --help` all print help — while still handing it over once
  argv belongs to a tool, so `harbor composer --help` reaches Composer and
  `harbor tool shop wkhtmltopdf --help` reaches wkhtmltopdf.
- **Docs: removed two flags that never existed.** `harbor link --wildcard` and
  `harbor redis flush` were documented in `README.md`, `plan.md` and the
  per-project **agent skill** but are absent from the code — so an agent following
  the skill would run a command that fails. The `*.<name>.test` SAN is added
  automatically for a Magento project with `multistore.mode: domain` (no flag);
  to flush, use `harbor redis <name> FLUSHDB` or `harbor down <name>` (which
  flushes all four of the project's indices).
- **Xdebug on the project CLI now connects like it does on the web.** With
  `harbor xdebug on`, the CLI shim set `xdebug.mode`/`start_with_request` but not
  the connection settings FPM gets, so it fell back to xdebug's `localhost`
  default — which resolves to `::1` first on macOS. An IDE listening on IPv4
  `127.0.0.1:9003` therefore never saw a session: breakpoints hit on a web request
  but silently did nothing on `XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1 harbor magento …`/`artisan`/
  `composer`. Both surfaces now build their flags from one `xdebug_dflags` helper
  (`client_host=127.0.0.1`, `client_port=9003`, `discover_client_host=false`), so
  web and CLI debugging can't drift apart again. Still trigger-based, so leaving
  Xdebug on stays cheap and unrelated CLI commands don't pay for it. (No action
  needed; the shim is regenerated on the next `harbor run`/`magento`/etc.)
- **Manifest `php_ini:` now applies to the project CLI, not just web.** The
  per-project php shim (`cli_php_pathdir`) previously injected only Xdebug flags,
  so `harbor magento`/`run`/`composer`/`artisan` ran at the host brew CLI's default
  `memory_limit` (typically 128M) — a Magento `setup:di:compile`/`indexer:reindex`
  would OOM despite `php_ini: { memory_limit: 2G }` in the manifest (that only
  reached web requests via FPM's `PHP_VALUE`). Harbor now emits the manifest
  `php_ini` block as `-d key=value` flags into the CLI shim too, mirroring the FPM
  path, so the manifest is the single source of truth for web **and** CLI ini. The
  shim is now keyed per project so two projects sharing a PHP version but pinning
  different ini don't clobber each other. (No manifest change needed; regenerated
  on the next `harbor run`/`magento`/etc.)
- **Containerized tool shims now work with entrypoint-based images.** The generated
  `.harbor/bin/<bin>` shim appended the binary name as a command argument, which
  double-invoked images that set the binary as their `ENTRYPOINT` (wkhtmltopdf,
  pandoc, ffmpeg, ghostscript) — e.g. `wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf …`, misparsing the
  first real argument as an input URL. Shims now default to
  `docker run --entrypoint <bin>` so the binary runs once. Images whose entrypoint
  does required init (s6-overlay wrappers like `linuxserver/libreoffice`) instead
  use `mode: command` — the binary runs as the container CMD *through* the image's
  `/init`, so it isn't bypassed. The catalog carries the mode; override per tool
  with manifest `tools.<name>.mode: entrypoint|command`. Re-run
  `harbor tools sync <name>` to regenerate existing shims.
- **`wkhtmltopdf` catalog image tag corrected** to `surnet/alpine-wkhtmltopdf:3.23.4-0.12.6-full`;
  the previous `3.0.1-0.12.6-full` tag does not exist on Docker Hub (pull 404'd).

### Added
- `harbor php use <ver>`: switch the **brew-linked** CLI `php` (what a plain
  terminal / IDE / global composer resolves) — unlinks the currently-linked
  version and `brew link --overwrite --force`s the requested one, verifying `php
  -v` afterwards. Separate from Harbor's per-project pinning: `harbor run`/nginx
  always use each project's own version regardless of what's linked here. (Touches
  brew's own link symlinks only — reversible via another `use`; no config-dir
  writes.)
- `harbor db import --force` (also honored by `db pull`): pass `--force` to
  `mysql` so it skips statements the server rejects and continues, instead of
  aborting the whole load. Unblocks prod dumps that `INSERT` explicit values into
  a **generated column** (e.g. Laravel Pulse's `pulse_aggregates.key_hash` →
  `ERROR 3105`); the offending rows are skipped (those tables land empty).

### Fixed
- `harbor db import`/`db pull`: DEFINER stripping no longer dies with
  `sed: RE error: illegal byte sequence` on dumps containing non-UTF-8 bytes
  (latin1/binary column data). The DEFINER `sed` now runs under `LC_ALL=C` so BSD
  sed processes the dump byte-wise (matching the serialized-safe replace step,
  which already did).
- Per-project `php_ini:` resource limits now actually apply. The FPM pool set
  `memory_limit` / `upload_max_filesize` / `post_max_size` / `max_execution_time`
  as `php_admin_value`, which PHP-FPM does not let a site's `PHP_VALUE` (how the
  manifest `php_ini:` is injected) or `ini_set()` override — so those keys were
  silently clamped to the pool default. They are now `php_value`, keeping the
  pool value (e.g. `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT`, default 2G) as the default a project can
  raise/lower. `error_log` and the CA-bundle paths stay `php_admin_value`
  (Harbor-owned/security). Run `harbor php sync` to apply to running pools.
- **Magento on-demand static assets now materialize in developer mode.** The
  Magento vhost body (`templates/nginx/body/magento.conf.tmpl`) routed missing
  static files to `static.php?resource=$1`, but inside the file-extension
  `location ~* \.(js|css|woff|ttf|…)$` block `$1` is the matched *extension*, so
  `static.php` received `resource=ttf` (→ "Requested path 'ttf' is wrong", 404).
  Assets already on disk (e.g. merged CSS) were served by `try_files`, but every
  file generated on first request (fonts, images, individual JS/CSS) 404'd and
  `pub/static/<area>/` never populated. Now uses Magento's canonical
  `if (!-f $request_filename) { rewrite ^/static/?(.*)$ /static.php?resource=$1 last; }`,
  whose own capture is the full resource path. Re-run `harbor link <name>` to
  regenerate the vhost (affects every Magento project).

### Added
- Committed Claude Code **Agent Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): `harbor-new-project`,
  `harbor-migrate-project` (existing-app onboarding + legacy gotchas), and
  `harbor-contributing` (rules + after-every-change checklist for modifying Harbor)
  — so developers/agents follow the same path.
- README **How-to (recipes)** section: new project, migrating an existing app,
  EOL PHP via the shivammathur tap, Xdebug on EOL PHP (prebuilt, not pecl), the
  MySQL 8 `caching_sha2_password` fix, changing a project's PHP version, and
  switching between Harbor and another Docker stack.
- Supported PHP set widened to `7.2 7.3 7.4 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5` (EOL versions
  installable via the `shivammathur/php` tap). A version only gets a pool once its
  `php-fpm` exists; `harbor php sync` picks up a newly-installed version.

### Fixed
- Launcher resolves `HARBOR_ROOT` robustly: honors an explicit `HARBOR_ROOT` env
  override, else follows symlinks to the repo, and fails with a clear, actionable
  message (symlink don't copy / set `HARBOR_ROOT`) instead of a cryptic
  "lib/common.sh: No such file" when the script was *copied* onto PATH.
- CLI Xdebug injection (`harbor run`/`composer`/…) now detects whether the PHP
  version's own config already loads Xdebug and only adds `-d zend_extension`
  when it doesn't — mirrors `fpm-exec.sh`, avoiding a double-load error when a
  `pecl`/tap install enabled Xdebug in brew's php.ini. Harbor now controls Xdebug
  correctly with or without that ini line, so **no manual edit of brew's php.ini
  is needed**.
- MySQL compose defaults to `--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password`
  so older PHP (7.2/7.3) mysqli clients can connect over TCP.
- Framework auto-detection now recognizes **CodeIgniter 3**: check
  `system/core/CodeIgniter.php` (not `system/CodeIgniter.php`) and match the
  `codeigniter/framework` composer package (not only `codeigniter4/framework`).
  CI3 projects were mis-detected as `plain`.

### Fixed (code review)
- **search-replace.php**: collect ALL primary-key columns and build a
  multi-column `WHERE` — composite-PK tables (e.g. Magento `catalog_category_product`,
  Laravel pivots) were matched by only the last PK column, updating multiple rows
  to one row's value (data corruption).
- **db import**: all temp files now live under one `mktemp -d` dir removed by an
  `EXIT` trap, so a mid-pipeline failure no longer leaks temp files / the mysql
  wrapper.
- **db create**: `db_ident` centralized in `common.sh` and now *validates*
  identifiers (rejects non `[A-Za-z0-9_]`), and the password is escaped for its
  SQL literal — explicit `db`/`user`/`password` args can no longer break or
  inject the root SQL.
- **db import `--stream-replace`**: `sed` now uses a `\001` delimiter and escapes
  regex metacharacters, and reports (not silently swallows) a failed rule — rules
  containing `|`, `&`, `.`, etc. work.
- **nginx**: `nginx_reload`/`nginx_test` announce their `sudo` (per CLAUDE.md
  "never sudo silently").
- **store add/rm**: store codes validated (`[A-Za-z0-9_]`) so the anchored `grep`
  can't over-match and drop unrelated stores.
- **manifest parser**: `_mf_split_top` tracks quote state, so a quoted value
  containing a comma (`["a, b", c]`) no longer splits incorrectly.

### Changed
- Cleanup pass (no behavior change): added `manifest_pairs` helper and used it in
  `link_php_value_block`, `link_map_block`, and `_store_pairs` (removes two
  hand-rolled flow-map loops and a per-key manifest re-read); promoted
  `_cli_php_pathdir` → public `cli_php_pathdir`; `_wait_ready` now batches one
  `docker inspect` for all containers; `db_import` caches the project PHP path;
  extracted `_tls_ensure_sans`; added `HARBOR_SHARED_REDIS` constant; completion
  emits `$HARBOR_PHP_VERSIONS`; dropped redundant `+ 0` in port math.
- Project blueprint: `plan.md` (full design + decisions) and `README.md`
  (user-facing docs).
- Agent guide `CLAUDE.md` (critical rules, anti-host-pollution rules, best
  practices, changelog discipline, mandatory after-every-change checklist:
  healthcheck → `.gitignore` → CHANGELOG → CLAUDE.md → security/perf/usability).
- Repo `.gitignore` (ignores rendered `etc/`, runtime `var/`, `certs/`, backups,
  project source; keeps platform dirs via `.gitkeep`).
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** `bin/harbor` dispatcher (`help`/`version`/`doctor`,
  planned-command stubs); `lib/common.sh` (paths, logging, templating, php +
  lock + config helpers); `lib/manifest.sh` (constrained-YAML manifest parser,
  no yq); `lib/ports.sh` (per-project port + shared-Redis DB-index allocator,
  lock-guarded); `lib/doctor.sh` (report-only host + per-project checks);
  `lib/launchd.sh` (com.harbor.* unit helpers).

### Changed
- Reconciled the early scaffolding to the final design: bash **3.2-safe**
  (no associative arrays / no `flock` → mkdir-based locking), per-version FPM
  sockets under `var/run/`, shared-Redis DB-index allocation (Redis/Mailpit port
  slots removed).

### Removed
- `lib/php.sh` switcher-era scaffold (superseded by concurrent ondemand pools,
  to be implemented in Phase 3).

### Fixed
- Harbor's dnsmasq port changed **5353 → 5354**: 5353 is the reserved mDNS/Bonjour
  port and conflicts with system multicast DNS. Overridable via config `DNS_PORT`.
- TLS now relies on **exact per-site SANs** (added at `harbor link`), not a bare
  `*.test` wildcard — Secure Transport/browsers reject wildcards directly under
  the reserved `.test` public suffix. One-level `*.<name>.test` (subdomain stores)
  is still honored. (Verified on macOS during Phase 2.)
- `nginx -t` runs under `sudo` during setup: this nginx binds listen sockets on
  `:80/:443` during config test, which a non-root user can't do.

### Phase 8 (Lifecycle, ergonomics, safety) — added
- `harbor new` (one-shot scaffold→init→up→wire→install→link→open); `status`
  (health + **self-heal** of dead `com.harbor.*` units, sudo-free port probes),
  `ps`/`list` (project table), consoles `mysql`/`redis`/`shell`, `open`, `secure`
  (reissue cert), `mail [up|down]`, `completion bash|zsh` (commands + project
  names). Full `harbor.md` runbook.
- **End-to-end verified live:** two projects on different PHP versions (8.3 + 8.4)
  served concurrently over trusted HTTPS; **provider→consumer HTTPS call verified
  via the CA bundle** (no `verify=false`); exact per-site SANs; no port collision;
  clean `destroy`.

### Phase 7 (Installers, DB lifecycle & data) — added
- `harbor db create|drop|backup|import` against the project's MySQL (root via
  `MYSQL_PWD`); credential convention db=user=pass=project. `import` is the full
  hookable pipeline: decompress → strip DEFINER → pre-import hooks → load
  (FK off) → **serialized-safe search/replace** (`lib/search-replace.php`,
  recomputes `s:N:` lengths) → post-import hooks (`*.sql` piped, scripts run) →
  optional Magento `--reconfigure`; auto-backup first; `--replace`, `--no-backup`,
  `--keep-definers`, `--no-hooks`, `--no-rules`, `--stream-replace` flags;
  `import-rules` file support.
- `harbor install|seed` (framework dispatch); Magento generates a wired,
  re-runnable `setup:install` script + local-DX pack (developer mode, disable 2FA,
  reindex) + `--reconfigure`. `harbor db pull` / `harbor media pull` over ssh
  (manifest `remote:`). `harbor store add|list|rm` (one mode per project;
  domain → nginx MAGE_RUN map + SAN, path → `web/url/use_store`).
- Verified live: create/backup/drop; full import pipeline incl. DEFINER strip,
  pre/post hooks, and serialized `s:8:"live.com"`→`s:10:"local.test"` with correct
  length recomputation; Magento install-script wiring; multistore map generation.

### Phase 6 (Config injection & tooling) — added
- `harbor wire`: surgical, allowlist-only, idempotent config injection with
  `.harbor-bak` backup — Laravel/CI4 `.env` per-key upsert, Symfony `.env.local`
  only, plain/CI3 `.harbor/connection.php`, Magento deferred to `install`.
- `harbor run` (any cmd under the project's pinned PHP, in its dir) + `composer`
  (pinned) + `artisan`/`console`/`spark`/`magento` passthroughs + `node`/`npm`
  via nvm (`.nvmrc`/manifest, prompts to install). **Xdebug-on-CLI**: a generated
  `php` shim adds Xdebug `-d` flags on demand when `xdebug on`.
- `harbor tool` / `harbor tools sync`: containerized CLI tools via shims in
  `.harbor/bin/` (project dir + `$TMPDIR` mounted at identical paths); built-in
  catalog + manifest override. No host installs. Verified: wire idempotency +
  backup, composer/run pinning, live Xdebug-on-CLI, tool shim + container run.

### Phase 5 (Per-project Docker stacks) — added
- `harbor init` (write manifest, allocate ports + Redis indices, render compose +
  connection files + `.harbor/.gitignore`); compose templates default (MySQL) and
  magento (MySQL + OpenSearch + RabbitMQ), loopback-bound, RAM-capped, with
  healthchecks; `harbor up` (with readiness wait) / `down` (Redis flush, keeps
  MySQL volume) / `restart` / `destroy` (drop volumes + ports + vhost) / `logs`.
  Compose files are fully rendered by Harbor (no `--env-file`). Verified: host PHP
  connects to the project's MySQL on its allocated port, Redis flush-on-down,
  volume persistence, and clean destroy.

### Phase 4 (Site provisioning) — added
- `harbor link <name>` / `harbor unlink <name>`: render a Harbor-owned nginx vhost
  (`etc/nginx/sites/<name>.test.conf`), add the site's **exact** cert SAN, reissue
  the shared cert, reload nginx. Framework auto-detection + manifest override;
  docroot detection (Magento `pub/`, Laravel/CI4/Symfony `public/`, Symfony legacy
  `web/`, CI3/plain root); per-site PHP routing; `fastcgi_param HTTPS on`,
  `client_max_body_size 128M`, `fastcgi_read_timeout`; per-site `PHP_VALUE` from
  manifest `php_ini`; custom `.harbor/nginx.conf` include; Magento domain-multistore
  `MAGE_RUN_CODE/TYPE` map. Verified: `https://hello.test` serves with a trusted
  cert (exact SAN), HTTP→HTTPS redirect, `https=on`, correct PHP version.

### Fixed
- Xdebug toggle now controls **`xdebug.mode`** (off vs debug,develop) rather than
  loading the extension — the host's brew PHP already loads Xdebug (and defaults
  `xdebug.mode=develop`, which has overhead). `harbor xdebug off` now genuinely
  makes it inert; still no brew config edits. `fpm-exec.sh` only adds
  `zend_extension` when the version doesn't already load it. (Host cleanup: the
  user's manually-added `zend_extension=xdebug.so` lines were removed from
  `php.ini` 8.1–8.5 — backed up to `php.ini.harbor-bak` — so the default baseline
  has no Xdebug and Harbor loads it on demand; off = fully unloaded.)

### Phase 3 (PHP control & Xdebug) — added
- `harbor php` (pool status with default marker / loaded / socket), `harbor php
  <ver>` (set default for new sites), `harbor php sync` (re-create pools for
  installed versions, drop uninstalled). `harbor xdebug on|off|status` toggles
  Xdebug across pools by rewriting `var/xdebug` and restarting pools (fpm-exec
  layers `-d` flags; no brew php config touched). Verified: status/set/sync work,
  toggle restarts pools, `xdebug.so` loads.

### Phase 2 (Host setup & teardown) — added
- `harbor setup` / `harbor teardown`; Harbor-owned dnsmasq (`:5354`) + resolver,
  wildcard cert + CA bundle, per-version ondemand FPM pools (LaunchAgents),
  own nginx (LaunchDaemon `:80/:443`), shared Mailpit+Redis stack; global config
  at `~/.config/harbor/config`. Verified end-to-end: DNS, pools, sockets, nginx,
  shared stack all up; brew nginx/php/dnsmasq config dirs untouched.
